What you'll learn The workshop is aimed at developers with some experience of both JavaScript and basic server-side programming in a language such as PHP, Python, Ruby or ASP.NET. It will cover the fundamentals of development with Node, then use those basic principles to build scalable solutions for real-world problems: pushing data to the browser with comet, robustly combining web services at scale, and adding rate limiting and caching to existing web applications using a Node-powered reverse proxy. Client-side developers should come away from the session with an understanding of how they can take their existing skills and apply them to server-side development, while server-side developers should gain a powerful new set of tools for solving problems that their current platform may not be able handle.

With the addition of CSS media queries to our arsenal of tools, it's finally becoming possible to design experiences that are truly native to the web rather than creating pages that are optimised only for a specific screen size. Jeremy is a web developer at Clearleft. He's written a few books, most recently HTML5 For Web Designers. He plays bouzouki in the band Salter Cane and writes on his website, adactio.com."

        "text": "This week's Async, with Aron Carroll and Premasagar Rose, is about creating browser-based web applications, using the \"MVC\" library Backbone.js. Web apps are increasingly dependent on a more intelligent layer of JavaScript in the browser. Helper libraries, such as jQuery, are indespensible for keeping the client-side logic sane, but anything more than a simple piece of software can soon get tangled in a spaghetti mess of code - event listeners, callbacks and DOM manipulations that can be fragile and tricky to maintain. Backbone is a tiny library that brings back a degree of clarity and control. It's inspired by the MVC approach of separating the Model (the data that the client reads from and writes to the server), the View (the DOM, and all the snippets of HTML that create each part of the user interface) and the Controller (the collection of code that orchestrates the behaviour of the app). Backbone makes it a breeze to have the user interface listen for changes to the data, and update accordingly. In a similar way, changes to the local data can be automatically sent back and synchronised with the server API. It's built on top of the brilliant Underscore.js, a handy swiss army-knife for manipulating arrays, objects and functions, and also takes advantage of jQuery or Zepto (a light, jQuery-like library for WebKit-mobile), if one of them is present. Altogether, it's a joy to use. Backbone avoids the constraints and burden of more heavyweight frameworks, and uses its expressiveness and lightness to put the fun back into app development. Aron and Prem will explain both Backbone and Underscore, and share their experiences of using the libraries on their recent projects.

        "text": "Micro frameworks have always existed as small scripts (say, less than 5kb of code) for handling very specific tasks, from templating to inheritance to animation. With the common JavaScript frameworks increasing in size with every release, people have begun to question whether all that code is necessary for your average site. Perhaps it’s possible to get away with a few small scripts that handle the majority of use cases. Recently, a couple of members of the Twitter team released Ender.js, a framework comprised of many smaller scripts that provides most of the functionality of jQuery at a third of the size. However, the really interesting part of the project is that its modular design allows any of the components to be swapped out allowing you to build a highly personalised toolkit. For this Async, we’ll take a look at a few of these micro frameworks and talk about the pros and cons of using them in your sites. We hope you’ll bring along your own frameworks that you’ve written, been using or even just earmarked out of curiosity. The format aims be very loose: we’ll bring up the code’s homepage or documentation, briefly outline what it can do before discussing its use cases and where you might like to use it. Here’s a few to get you thinking: $script: JavaScript source code loader Event.js: Cross browser event handling. Mustache: Cross platform templating Emile: LightWeight animation We look forward to seeing you there! Some links for light reading We thought it would be nice for posterity to add links to the frameworks we discussed on the night. If we've missed any please do let us know! Lettering JS: Great jQuery plugin for playing manipulating text. Head JS: Script loading, feature detection, HTML5 shim and more all rolled into one. Event JS: Cross browser DOM event library, supports keyboard shortcuts and hash change events. Emilie: Tiny animation utility. Firmin: Interesting CSS3 animation library. getscript: Super simple script loader. MicroEvent: Easily add publish/subscribe methods to your objects. Amplify JS: Pub/Sub, persistence and request toolkit.

We've been able to embed images, video and other media on websites, now fonts too can be embedded without relying on hacks such as Cufon and sIFR to achieve this. There are a variety of solutions for delivering fonts to your web page, and there are best practices to consider which will ensure speed and reliability when delivering web fonts. Josh Emerson will talk about implementing web fonts for cross browser support, highlighting design considerations and potential pitfalls. He will also talk about using the Google WebFont Loader which offers greater control over loading web fonts.

        "text": "The Application Cache is one of the cool bits of HTML5, allowing sites to work without a network connection, which brings us much closer to native app-like behaviour. However, from HTML5 roundup articles and talks, you may be left with the impression that it's a magic-bullet fix. Unfortunately it isn't; the Application Cache is a douchebag. That's not to say 'incompetent' or 'difficult' - definitely 'douchebag'. The Application Cache has skills we need, but if you asked him to paint your bathroom, he'd somehow manage to flood your kitchen and break your TV in the process, and he wouldn't care. We'll learn how to use the features of Application Cache without the horrible side effects, comparing techniques you'd use for a simple client-side app and a large content-driven site.

The problems require not just computer science, but also aesthetics and taste. My current side-project is a small mathematical programming language, called Turo. It is an interesting project, and it is now time to add new language features. When adding language features, there is a fun bit where we get to make up the language to write and think in. The aim of this workshop is to give you a sense of this fun. Non-confrontational audience participation is expected. Although very little of the code in this workshop will be Javascript, there is also a discussion about a number of Javascript tools to help you build your own little languages."

At Clearleft, over the course of a year, we moved to using Virtual Machines for local development and unmanaged servers for our hosting. We then wrote a command-line tool focused on simplifying local development and managing our remote servers. We called it ‘Elf’.</p>\n<p>In this talk I’d like to share our setup, the system we built and some of the things we’ve learnt along the way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Graham will be joined by Yann Eves with his talk &quot;Generate yo&#39; Generators&quot;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Autonomy in the way we produce a working solution from source and serving static files are nothing new. However, in a trend plagued by <em>new</em> it&#39;s clearly important to revisit technologies that have since lost the hype, even dated as far as 2012 (gasp!) or 2008 (faint!).

        "text": "In this special two for one evening, we'll be welcoming Graham Smith to the Async stage for the first time, with a talk entitled \"From Local To Live\": Local development environments and deploying to live servers can be tricky and also subjective. At Clearleft, over the course of a year, we moved to using Virtual Machines for local development and unmanaged servers for our hosting. We then wrote a command-line tool focused on simplifying local development and managing our remote servers. We called it ‘Elf’. In this talk I’d like to share our setup, the system we built and some of the things we’ve learnt along the way. Graham will be joined by Yann Eves with his talk \"Generate yo' Generators\". Autonomy in the way we produce a working solution from source and serving static files are nothing new. However, in a trend plagued by new it's clearly important to revisit technologies that have since lost the hype, even dated as far as 2012 (gasp!) or 2008 (faint!). We're not averted to making things complicated in the world of JavaScript, which often leads to us putting off cool side-projects, open source contributions, or what have you.. In this talk, I'd like to introduce some changes I've been working on for the Async website static site engine, as well as how you can make use of my hipster discoveries to bring forward your own side-projects, or even.. a blog!
